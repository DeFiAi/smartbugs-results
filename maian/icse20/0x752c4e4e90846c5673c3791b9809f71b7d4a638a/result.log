/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/eth_utils/string.py:22: DeprecationWarning: The `force_obj_to_bytes` function has been deprecated and will be removed in a subsequent release of the eth-utils library. UTF8 cannot encode some byte values in the 0-255 range which makes naive coersion between bytes and text representations impossible without explicitly declared encodings.
